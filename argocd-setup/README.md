# ArgoCD Implementation

This directory contains the necessary files to set up ArgoCD on your Kubernetes cluster for continuous delivery.

## Overview

ArgoCD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It automates the deployment of applications to Kubernetes clusters by monitoring Git repositories and applying changes when they are detected.

## Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster
- kubectl configured to communicate with your cluster
- Helm v3 installed

## Installation

To install ArgoCD on your cluster:

1. Make the installation script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x install-argocd.sh
   ```

2. Run the installation script:
   ```
   ./install-argocd.sh [namespace]
   ```
   
   If no namespace is provided, the script will use the default namespace.

## What the Script Does

The `install-argocd.sh` script:

1. Creates the specified namespace if it doesn't exist
2. Adds the ArgoCD Helm repository
3. Installs ArgoCD with LoadBalancer service type
4. Waits for the deployment to complete
5. Displays the service details and initial admin password

## Accessing ArgoCD

After installation:

1. Access the ArgoCD UI using the LoadBalancer external IP displayed in the output
2. Log in with:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: The initial password displayed by the installation script

## Next Steps

After logging in:

1. Change the admin password
2. Delete the `argocd-initial-admin-secret` for security
3. Set up your applications using the ArgoCD UI or CLI
4. Connect your repository in settings in the ArgoCD UI
5. Create application in the ArgoCD UI
